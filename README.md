In the winter of 2018 I founded two companies. While the mission of each business is entirely different, both are centered on deep learning techonology. The first question that came to mind when forming these two companies was; "How do I manage a business in order to maximize the efficiency of myself and the team?" The answer was, create a mediawiki server for each. 

The use of mediawiki as an organizational tool was not foreign to me, since I have worked for years in an experiemental physics research laboratory. In the scientific community wiki servers are an invaluable resource, and perfect for keeping projects with multiple team members organized. It was however not a familiar tool in the world of project management. 

This repository will serve as a test case and proof of concept, to determine if a mediawiki server can in fact handle all of the demands a software project generates. I will post my findings for generating a Gannt chart style project schedule, table based milestone tracker, team accessable event calendar, source code repo, and general wiki maintanance using python based bot scripts. The goal is this documentation is to answer any questions regarding the use of a mediawiki server to successfully manage a project of any type, but more specifically an engineering project with 4 - 10 team members.
